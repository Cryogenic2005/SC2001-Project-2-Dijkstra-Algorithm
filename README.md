## About the program

The program is intended to compare 2 implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm:
- **Implementation 1:** The graph is stored as an *adjacency matrix* & the algorithm uses an *array* for the priority queue.
- **Implementation 2:** The graph is stored as an *adjacency list* & the algorithm uses a *minimizing heap* for the priority queue.

Other things to note:
- The program can generate a random graph using specified arguments to run the algorithm on.
- The program will output the CPU time used for each algorithm to help with the comparison.
